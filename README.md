## About The Project

This repository hosts a Jupyter notebook implementation of a **Fashion Customer Service Assistant** powered by Hugging Face Transformers. It can understand natural language queries related to product details, sizing guidance, shipping information, returns, styling tips, and more—simulating a human-like support experience.

Key goals:

* Reduce support workload by automating common customer questions
* Improve response consistency and quality across inquiries
* Provide an extensible framework for integrating domain-specific knowledge

## Features

* 🔄 **Multi-turn conversation**: Retains context across user interactions.
* 🎨 **Fashion-specific intents**: Prebuilt support for queries about products, sizing, materials, availability, and style advice.
* 🛍️ **E-commerce integration**: Easily plug in your product catalog or FAQ database for retrieval-augmented responses.
* 🛠️ **Flexible model choices**: Swap between `DialoGPT`, `BlenderBot`, `T5`, or custom fine-tuned models.
* ⚙️ **Pipeline-based architecture**: Leverages Hugging Face `pipeline()` for streamlined inference.


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rishi-Kora/Customer-Service-Assistant-using-HuggingFace-for-Fashion-Industry.git
   cd Customer-Service-Assistant-using-HuggingFace-for-Fashion-Industry
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

> **Note:** If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, install directly:
>
> ```bash
> pip install transformers torch accelerate sentencepiece
> ```

## Usage

1. **Open the notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fashion_Customer_service_chatbot_using_HF.ipynb
   ```
2. **Review and run each cell** to:

   * Load or fine-tune the conversational model
   * Define and map intents for customer queries
   * Launch the chat interface within the notebook
3. **Interact** with the assistant by typing sample customer questions.

### Example Queries

```text
- "What sizes does the Summer Maxi Dress come in?"
- "Can I return an item if it doesn’t fit?"
- "How long is shipping to the UK?"
- "What fabric is this blazer made of?"
- "Can you suggest an outfit for a beach party?"
```

## Customization

* **Change model**: Edit the `model_name` variable to use any Hugging Face conversational checkpoint.
* **Add intents**: Extend the `intents.json` or your mapping logic in the notebook to cover new question categories.
* **Plug in a knowledge base**: Integrate with FAISS or Elasticsearch to fetch answers from your FAQ documents.

## Development

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a pull request

Please ensure your code adheres to existing style and includes relevant tests or usage examples.

## Deployment

You can deploy this assistant behind any messaging UI or web framework:

* **Streamlit**: Build a simple UI (`streamlit run app.py`)
* **FastAPI**: Expose REST endpoints for inference
* **Docker**: Containerize the notebook or API for cloud deployment

## Roadmap

* [ ] Add retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for dynamic FAQs
* [ ] Support multi-language customer support
* [ ] Integrate with a real-time chat widget frontend
* [ ] Provide metrics dashboard for conversation analytics
